# Crypto Challenge Set 8

> https://cryptopals.com/sets/8

This is the second of two sets we generated after the original 6.

This set focuses on abstract algebra, including DH, GCM, and (most importantly) elliptic curve cryptography. 
Fair warning - it's really tough! There's a ton of content here, and it's more demanding than anything we've released so far. 
By the time you're done, you will have written an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of one percent of SageMath.

## Table of contents
