My writeups and python solutions to the challenges of https://cryptopals.com/.

The **Matasano crypto challenges** (cryptopals) take the form of practical attacks against cryptographic vulnerabilities. 

Some of the cryptographic topics covered:

- Basic substitution and XOR
- Pseudo-random number generators
- Stream and  block ciphers and their modes of operation
- Message authentication codes
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange
- RSA (public-key cryptography)
